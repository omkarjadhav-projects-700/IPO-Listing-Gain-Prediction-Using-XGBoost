Rolex Rings IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Though RRLâ€™s top line has shown declining trends, its higher earnings following deferred tax and other provisions and reasonable pricing make it is a worthy bet for short to long term rewards. The company will be a debt-free company in the near term and will pose for bright prospects ahead once normalcy is restored. Off late we are also witnessing fancy for forging companies. Investment may be considered. Read detail review...
