Emcure Pharmaceuticals IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is one of the leading pharma company having niche products and serving global markets. It marked growth in its top lines, but bottom line posted declining trends due to higher interest and depreciation costs. Based on FY24 earnings, the issue appears fully priced.
