PB Fintech IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Though the company is in operation for over a decade, it has not yet broken the ice to turn green. Based on all parameters, the issue is exorbitantly priced. No doubt recent madness for Unicorn and Tech IPOs following Zomato is still continuing and accepting fancy pricing of loss-making companies. Though the company has bright prospects going forward, its issue pricing discounts all near term positives. Hence, risk seeker/cash surplus investors may consider investment for the long term, others may avoid it. Read detail review...
