Udayshivakumar Infra IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company posted inconsistencies in its top and bottom lines for the reported periods. It has an order book of Rs. 1290 cr. as of December 31, 2022. Rising GST recovery from Government bodies raises concern. Based on its FY 23 annualized earnings, the issue appears fully priced. The initial listing in the T group may curtail speculative moves. Well-informed/cash surplus investors may consider parking funds for the long term. Read detail review...
