Swiggy IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is an emerging e-commerce and food delivery related technology driven service provider. It posted steady growth in its top lines for the reported periods, but reported losses for all the while. Based on its financial performance, the IPO is having negative P/E and aggressive pricing based on other parameters. The management is confident of turning its operations profitable in coming few years with the strategy implied and with the funds from the IPO, hopes to scale up all offerings. Well-informed/cash surplus/risk seekers may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
