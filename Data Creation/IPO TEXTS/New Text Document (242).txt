Nuvoco Vistas IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Considering mega spending for infra developments including affordable housing plans afoot, demand for cement is going to be high and thus, this 5th mega player in the segment is poised for bright prospects. NVCLâ€™s current debt is around Rs. 6887 cr. which will be reduced by Rs. 1350 cr. from IPO proceeds, still it will have over Rs. 5537 cr. outstanding. On the current financial parameters, its P/E is unascertainable, but the image of Nirma group and the bright scope going forward makes this IPO a pure long term story for cash surplus investors.
