ACME Solar Holdings IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is providing all kind of power generation services and products. It attributed fall in profits for FY23 due to impact of amortization and sale of some projects, and the sudden boost in bottom lines in FY24 for higher other income and exceptional items. However, based on its FY25 annualized earnings, the issue appears exorbitantly priced, but based on super profits of FY24, it appears fully priced. Well-informed investors may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
