Sah Polymers IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is operating in a highly competitive segment with two of its group company having an interest in a similar business. There are many other points of concern. Even based on its super earnings the issue is highly-priced. Initial listing in the “T” group may curtail speculative movements in the initial period. There is no harm in skipping this pricy bet.
