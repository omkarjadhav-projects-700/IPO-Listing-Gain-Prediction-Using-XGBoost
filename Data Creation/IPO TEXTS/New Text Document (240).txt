Ami Organics IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Based on super financial performance for FY21, the issue is fully priced. The sustainability of such higher margins going forward is a major concern. Many options at cheaper valuations are available in secondary markets. On financial parameters, AOL is no way near to its listed peers. Greedy pricing is perhaps on account of the current fancy for chemical counters. Hence risk seeker/cash surplus investors may take a call of investment with a long term perspective.
