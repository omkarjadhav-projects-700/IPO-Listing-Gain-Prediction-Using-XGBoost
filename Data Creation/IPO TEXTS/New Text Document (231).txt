Fino Payments Bank IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is a novel technology company in the financial sector. It has established its play and enjoys a niche place. Perhaps due to such status, it is trying its maiden float with fancy pricing which is exorbitant on all counts.

Considering all these, risk seeker/cash surplus investors may consider investment for the long term. Read detail review...
