LIC IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Ever since LIC announced its IPO plans, it became the talk of the town and more so after filing its DRHP in February 2022. Investors across the board were busy calculating its valuations considering its mammoth size of business and market share amidst competition. Now that it has filed RHP and its issue details are announced, its pricing mirroring embedded value and business growth trajectory appears reasonable. With its investor-friendly move with a discount to its pillars i.e. policyholders as well as retail investors, the issue has now turned more attractive. The government of India has again shown their investor-friendly gestures with such moves amidst troubling times like the Russia-Ukraine war, spiralling inflation, and weak global markets. Investors may consider investing in this mega insurer’s maiden mini offer for medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
