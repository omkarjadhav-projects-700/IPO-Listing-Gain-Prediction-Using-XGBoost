IRM Energy IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  IEL is an emerging player in CGD segment with penetration in three states where ample opportunities are envisaged. The company marked growth in its top and bottom lines except for FY23 where it marked pressure on margins following surge in petroleum and gas prices due to Ukraine-Russia war. FY24-Q1 performance indicates return of normalcy and the management is confident of maintaining growth. Based on annualized FY24 numbers, the issue appears fully priced. It is a long race horse. Investors may park funds for the medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
