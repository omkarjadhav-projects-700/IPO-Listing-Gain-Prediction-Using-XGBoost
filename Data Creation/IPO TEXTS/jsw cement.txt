JSW Cement IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  JCL is a JSW group’s cement manufacturing arm, and is one of the top three fastest growing company in India. After profitable performance for FY23 and FY24, it marked heavy loss for FY25, that raises major concern. It is setting up a new unit at Nagaur-Rajasthan that will add to its top and bottom lines going forward. Based on its recent financial data, the issue appears aggressively priced. Being a pure long-term story, only will-informed/cash surplus investors may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
