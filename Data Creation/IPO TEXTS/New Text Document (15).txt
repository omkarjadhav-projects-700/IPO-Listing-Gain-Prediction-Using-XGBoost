Schloss Bangalore IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Well, the company is a well-known global brand and is known for luxury hospitality with premium service offerings. The management is confident of maintaining its tradition with planned expansion. It turned the corner for FY25 and poised for fast forward mode with its expansion plans. Repayment of certain debts from IPO funds will reduce its finance cost drastically. Based on its financial data, the IPO appears exorbitantly priced, and is a pure long-term story. Well-informed/Cash surplus investors may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
