Windlas Biotech IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Despite growth in its top lines, WBL has posted declining trends for bottom lines in order to clear its slate. Based on its financial parameters, the issue is aggressively priced. All recent moves will take about two years to be on a fast forward mode. Thus it is purely a long term bet at the current valuations that discounts all near term positives. Cash surplus investors may consider it with a long term perspective. Read detail review...
