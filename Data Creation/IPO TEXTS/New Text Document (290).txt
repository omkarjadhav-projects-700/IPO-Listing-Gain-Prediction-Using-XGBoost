Shine Fashions IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Non-impressive financial performance, minuscule working data (just for 9 month's) and the tiny equity raise concern. The issue is exorbitantly priced considering negative earnings for the two months of the ongoing fiscal. Investors may keep away from this company which is coming with a fully structured model of issue. Due to the structured model, the issue is likely to sail through. Read detail review...
