Burger King IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Burger King met with fancy among younger generation that helped the company for speedy expansion of its footprint. But in the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic and changing lifestyle habits and shifting preference with rising awareness of immunity diet, Burger King will find it difficult to maintain the progress made in the last five fiscals. Company has huge carried forward losses that are represented in its NAV of Rs. 7.62 (against face value of Rs. 10) as on September 30, 2020. Thus issue appears aggressively priced. Due to its carried forward losses, BKIL has reserved 75% quota for QIBs and they may support the issue for smooth sailing. Extended gestation period may take long to wipe out accumulated losses. The segment is crowded with many organized/unorganized players and posing tough competition. Once normalcy restores, BKIL may achieve the targeted plans. Considering all these, cash surplus, risk savvy investors may consider investing in this issue with a long term perspective. Read detail review...
