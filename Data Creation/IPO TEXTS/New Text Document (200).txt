Hariom Pipe Industries IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is a south centric player in its field. It has reported bumper profits for the last one and half fiscal that raises eyebrows but as per clarification, it's due to rising in commodity prices globally. Based on this performance, the issue is fully priced, but, it is worth considering for the medium to long term due to competitive value against peers. The listing will be in a “T” group for the initial period, which may rule out a speculative move. Investors may consider an investment with a short to long term perspective. Read detail review...
