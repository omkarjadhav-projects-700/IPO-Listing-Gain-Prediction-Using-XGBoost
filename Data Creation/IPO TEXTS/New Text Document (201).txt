Uma Exports IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  UEL’s financial performance has shown inconsistency in exports revenue as well as in domestic markets. It has posted super earnings for the last two and half fiscal which raises concern over its sustainability. Turning down of support by QIBs indicates something fishy for this company’s records. Its business also carries the risk of seasonality and Government policies for commodities trades. Based on its FY22 super earnings, the issue price appears aggressive compared to its peer. There is no harm in skipping this issue. Read detail review...
