Sigachi Industries IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has been faring well and paying dividends. The issue is reasonably priced based on its financial performance and the virtual monopolistic nature of business, it is poised for bright prospects. Due to the small size of the IPO, the initial listing will be in the T group that may curtail speculative moves. Investors may consider an investment with a medium to long term perspective.
