Global Surfaces IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is in the business of processing natural stones and manufacturing engineered quartz. It has shown declining trends in its RoE and RoCE. Based on FY23 annualized earnings, the issue is aggressively priced. It is also in the highly competitive segment. The initial listing will be in the “T” group and there may not be any speculative move on debut. Hence well-informed/cash-surplus investors may consider an investment with a long-term perspective.
