Dreamfolks IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  DSL enjoys a 95% market share and enjoys first-mover status in the segment. It has been an asset-light business model gaining the preference of air travellers. However, on account of the pandemic scare, it suffered a setback in its earnings at the PAT level for FY21 and due to this, it is offering only 10% for retail investors. Though prima facie the issue appears aggressively priced, it is worth considering from a medium to long-term perspective. Read detail review...
