C.E.Info systems IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  While the company posted average performances for FY19 and FY20, super earnings since FY21 onwards remains a concern for the sustainability of such margins going forward. The issue is priced aggressively to encase the first mover tag. Based on financial parameters too the issue is highly-priced. Hence the cash surplus/risk seekers may consider investment for long term. Other may stay away. Read detail review...
