Krsnaa Diagnostics IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Healthcare sector counters marked hefty gains amidst pandemic scare and currently witnessing some corrections from the higher levels. KDL has posted net profits for FY21 on account of one-time gains and even with these earnings, its issue is aggressively priced at a P/E of 80+ and is thus a costly bet against listed peers. In fact, it has a negative P/E. The segment is highly fragmented with many unorganized players and also having tough competitions from organized players. Considering all these, cash surplus/risk seekers may consider investing in this highly-priced offer, others can avoid. Read detail review...
