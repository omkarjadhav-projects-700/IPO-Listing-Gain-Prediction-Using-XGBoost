Kalyan Jewellers IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  KJIL is the second-largest PAN India retailer of gold and other fancy jewellery. It has shown static financial performance for FY18 and FY20, whereas it suffered a minor setback for FY19 due to the flood situation in southern regions, its prime locations. It has suffered a setback for FY21-9M following pandemic and incurred losses. Thus, the offer price is at a negative P/E based on the latest financial data. There is a big difference in financial parameters between the two mega players in the field. As the pricing of the issue is having a negative P/E based on the latest workings, cash surplus, risk savvy investors may consider investment at their own risks. Read detail review...
