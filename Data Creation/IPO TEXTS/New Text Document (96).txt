Exicom Tele-Systems IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is the first mover in power management solution and EV charging infrastructure. It has 60% market share in EV charging segment and is poised for bright prospects ahead with shift from conventional fuel to EV vehicles globally. The company marked a minor setback for FY23 top-line due to hiving off of its battery related business. Based on FY24 annualized earnings, the issue appears fully priced. However, considering the rising opportunities and timely expansion plans, investors may lap it up for the medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
