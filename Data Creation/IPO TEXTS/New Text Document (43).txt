Suraksha Diagnostic IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is a one-stop pathology and radiology testing, and medical consultation services solution provider having East region centric play. It enjoys market share of around 1.26% in the area of its operation and that is scaling up with its new centre opening, which adds to its top line and over the period start contributing to its bottom line. It suffered a minor setback for FY23 due to non-contribution of such centres opened in FY22 and their related expenses. However, the company is back on track as indicated by FY24 performance and is poised for bright prospects with its expansion plans afoot. Based on FY25 annualized earnings, the issue appears fully priced discounting all near term positives. However, well-informed investors may park funds for long term. Read detail review...
