Indegene IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has a unique business model and enjoys virtual monopoly in its business that generates over 98% global revenue. It marked steady growth in its top and bottom lines for the reported periods, and the segment is poised for bright prospects ahead. Based on FY24 annualized earnings, the issue appears fully priced, but considering its niche play, it is reasonably priced leaving something on table for one and all. Investors may lap up this IPO for the medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
