De Neers Tools IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  After average performances for FY20 and FY21, the company posted robust bottom lines for FY22 (two broken periods) and for 7M of FY23. The company operates in a highly competitive and fragmented segment with many big players around. Based on recent super earnings, the issue appears fully priced while based on its track records so far, the issue appears aggressively priced. The small equity capital post-IPO indicates a longer gestation period for migration to the mainboard. There is no harm in skipping this issue. Read detail review...
