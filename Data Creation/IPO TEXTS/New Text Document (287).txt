Net Pix Shorts Digital Media IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has presented financial data for around 12 months in total for two fiscals. Based on Q!-FY21 negative earnings, its P/E cannot be ascertained. The issue is exorbitantly priced on all parameters. Its tiny equity post IPO also indicates higher gestation for migration to the mainboard. Investors may skip this highly-priced issue.
