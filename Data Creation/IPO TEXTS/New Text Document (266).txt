Barbeque-Nation Hospitality IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  As per financial data the company has posted a cumulated loss of Rs. 154.78 cr. For the last 32 months working which is alarming. Management has clarified that due to its ongoing expansion plans and higher provisions for depreciation etc., it has posted losses. But looking at the losses made in the first eight months of the current fiscal on account of pandemic scare and resurgence of the same since past one week or so, immediate future appears gloomy. There is no certainty of restoration of normalcy in the near term and thus, it may continue to face the music. It made pre-IPO placement at Rs. 252 per share just two months before and now asking nearly double the price. Considering all these and the negative P/E, cash surplus, risk savvy investors may consider parking their hard-earned money at their own risks. Read detail review...
