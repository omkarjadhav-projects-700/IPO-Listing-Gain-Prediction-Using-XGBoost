Venus Pipes IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Rising trends in commodity markets helped this company to post super performance and considering bright prospects, it is on an expansion spree. Based on its latest performance, the issue appears fully priced. Its capacity will be more than doubled post-expansion. As the issue is below Rs. 250 cr. its initial listing will be in “T” group with restricted circuits and that will remove speculative activities for the initial listing period. Investors may consider an investment with medium to long term perspectives. Read detail review...
