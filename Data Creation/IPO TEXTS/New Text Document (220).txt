Shriram Properties IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has been posting losses at the net level since FY20. H1 of FY22 too indicates a further dip in profits. The company claims that it has priced the IPO reasonably. The only favourable point, for now, is the Shriram Group tag and their efforts to back on track in the near term. Thus this issue is purely and only for long term investors who have surplus funds and risk appetite. Others can skip this issue and may buy at dip post listings. Read detail review...
