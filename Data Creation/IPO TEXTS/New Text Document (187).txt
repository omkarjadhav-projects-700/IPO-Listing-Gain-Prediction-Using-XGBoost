Syrma SGS Technology IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company did a pre-IPO placement at Rs. 290 a few months back and now it is coming with IPO at Rs. 220 (at the upper cap). This really augurs well for this IPO, but based on its financial data and earnings, the issue is priced at a P/E of 50+ even at lower IPO pricing. The company is focusing on a high-margin product portfolio. The segment in which SSTL is operating is also poised for bright prospects ahead. Hence investors may consider an investment with medium to long-term perspectives. Read detail review...
