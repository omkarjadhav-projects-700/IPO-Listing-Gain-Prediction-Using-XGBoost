Stove Kraft IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]   If we consider H1 FY 21 (IPO year) super earnings, the issue appears fully priced. Sustainability of such performance going forward is a major concern. If we consider FY20 performance, the issue is priced aggressively. Due to losses for FY18, it had opted for higher QIB portion in IPO. Perhaps the company has hurried for its IPO plan to encase boom in the secondary market. Considering all these, cash surplus, risk savvy investors may consider investment at their own risk.
