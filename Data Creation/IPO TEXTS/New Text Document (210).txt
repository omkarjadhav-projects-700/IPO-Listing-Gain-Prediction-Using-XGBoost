Timescan Logistics IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Based on its financial and other parameters, the issue is fully priced. It is operating in a highly competitive and fragmented segment with south centric presence and operations. Declining trends of business with top 10 customers and suppliers raise concerns. Small equity base post IPO indicates longer gestation for migration to the mainboard. Risk seeker/cash surplus investors may consider investing in this fully priced issue, others may avoid it. Read detail review...
