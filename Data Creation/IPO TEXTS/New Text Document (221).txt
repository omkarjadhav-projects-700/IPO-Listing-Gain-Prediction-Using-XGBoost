Rategain Travel Technologies IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  While this company has been posting losses post-pandemic in line with general trends for the segments, it kept adding its services and has widened its products folio from 4 to 10 during this period. Opening up of the economy will have fast forward mode for travel and hospitality segment which augurs well for this global player. No doubt, the ongoing pandemic scare with a new variant (Omicron) is keeping a tab on the general sentiment, RTTL will emerge as the niche player with its widened product portfolio.

Negative earnings are a concern for a while, but keeping future prospects in mind, risk seeker/cash surplus investors may consider an investment with a long term perspective. Others may skip it.
