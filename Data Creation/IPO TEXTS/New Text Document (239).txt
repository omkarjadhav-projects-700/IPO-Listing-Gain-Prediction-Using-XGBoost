Vijaya Diagnostic Centre IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  This is a majorly south centric diagnostic service provider. The issue is fully priced based on its super performance so far. The segment is getting crowded post-pandemic and thus creating high competition going forward. The recent IPO of south based Krsnaa Diagnostic performed miserably post a listing. This is a pure secondary offer. Considering all these parameters, risk seekers/cash surplus investors may consider an investment with a long term perspective. Read detail review...
