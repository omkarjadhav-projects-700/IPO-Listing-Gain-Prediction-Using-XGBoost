Honasa Consumer IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has posted fast growth in the last five years with over 65% EBITDA margins and is poised for bright prospects ahead. It enjoys asset light model of business. It is now considering offline marketing with its own outlets and will continue to launch more products in coming years. Based on annualized FY24 earnings, the issue is aggressively priced discounting all near term positives. Perhaps the company is abstracting fancy valuation for its proven track record so far. Well-informed investors may consider parking moderate funds for medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
