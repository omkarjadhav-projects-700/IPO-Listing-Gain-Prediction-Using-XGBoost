Quadpro ITeS IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  QIL is in a highly competitive and fragmented segment. The last three fiscalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s financial data have shown declining trends in the top line. Super profits for FY21 i.e. in the pre-IPO year raises eyebrows. IPO pricing is very aggressive though based on such super earnings. The company is way behind its peers in turnover aspects. Considering all these, one may ignore this issue. Read detail review...
