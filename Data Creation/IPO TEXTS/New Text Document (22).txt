Dr.Agarwal's Health Care IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is engaged in eye care business providing all eye health related treatments. While its top line marked steady growth for the reported periods, it posted pressure on margins for FY23. It has nearly 25% market share in its business of eye-care related services. Based on recent financial performance, the issue appears exorbitantly priced. Only well-informed/cash surplus/risk seekers may park moderate funds for long term considering future prospects.
