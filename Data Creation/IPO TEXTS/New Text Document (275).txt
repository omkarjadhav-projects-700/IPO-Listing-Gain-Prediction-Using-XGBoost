Easy Trip Planners IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Based on its financial data, the issue appears fully priced. Being the first mover in the online travel service segment with niche play, the company may attract fancy post listing. ETPL is operating an asset-light model of business with negligible borrowings. Rising trade receivables and trade payables coupled with declined bank deposits are the major concerns. Considering all these, investors may consider investing in this IPO with a long term perspective. Read detail review...
