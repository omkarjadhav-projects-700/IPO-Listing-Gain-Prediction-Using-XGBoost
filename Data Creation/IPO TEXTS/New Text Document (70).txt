Ola Electric Mobility IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is a pure E2W play emerging leader and with many big and small company’s dropping their hat in the fray, sphere competition is shaping ahead. Ola has laid down its future path with its future factory and Gigafactory to take on any kind of competition. In fact, the company is planning to enter E-2W bikes, three wheeler, cars and most importantly the 4680 Li-thion battery where it mulls it making a global hub for EV batteries. While its top line has been surging year-on-year, its bottom line marked improvement in reduced losses. No doubt it will take some more time to turn the corner and wipe out the losses. Thus it’s a pure long term investment bet. Well-informed investors may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
