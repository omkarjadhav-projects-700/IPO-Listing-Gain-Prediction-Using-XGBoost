SBFC Finance IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Of late we have media reports of MSME loans turning NPAs for financiers, however, this company has shown a decline in its NPAs over the past three fiscals. But with rising competition, and RBI's frequently changing monetary policies, the company may suffer going forward as it has already marked a decline in its NIM for the last three fiscals. Based on its FY23 earnings, the IPO appears aggressively priced compared to its peers. Only well-informed/cash surplus/ risk seeker investors may park funds for the medium to long term in this costly IPO. Read detail review...
