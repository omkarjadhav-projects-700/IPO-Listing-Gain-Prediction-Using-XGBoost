RO Jewels IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  ROJL's financial performance is showing inconsistency. It has only one showroom with just 9 employees (including 2 directors and 1 company secretary) as on filing of offer documents. On the basis of supper earnings for H1 FY20, the issue appears fully priced. Company's bankers are trouble ridden Yes Bank Ltd. LM has a poor track record with similar issues in the past. Simply stay away from this IPO. Read detail review...
