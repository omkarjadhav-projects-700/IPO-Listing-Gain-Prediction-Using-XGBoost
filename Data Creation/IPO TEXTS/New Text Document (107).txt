Jyoti CNC Automation IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  After suffering a setback for FY21 and FY22, the company has turned the corner and currently has an order book of Rs. 3315+ cr. on hand. However, based on its FY23 earnings, the issue is priced at a P/E of 501.52 and on annualized FY24 earnings, it is at a P/E of 1103.33. Thus the issue appears exorbitantly priced discounting all near term positives. Only well-informed cash surplus investors may park funds for the long term, while others may ignore, as it is a long race horse. Read detail review...
