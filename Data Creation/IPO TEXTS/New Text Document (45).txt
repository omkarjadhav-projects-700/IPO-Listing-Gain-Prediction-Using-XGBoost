NTPC Green Energy IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is one of the leading renewable power generating PSU having solar and wind power generation assets. It is also adding hydroelectric assets and giving thrust of power storage plans. Though the company posted net profits for the reported financial periods, based on FY25 annualized earnings, the IPO is aggressively priced. Well-informed/cash surplus investors may park moderate funds for long term, as this is a pure long term bet. Read detail review...
