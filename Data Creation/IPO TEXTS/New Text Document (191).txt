Ethos IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has posted inconsistency in its financial performance and the super earnings for 9M-FY22 raise eyebrows as well as concern over sustainability going forward. It is asking for a higher price at the upper band against pre-IPO placement done at Rs. 826 in March 2022. Even if we arrive at the P/E based on its super earnings, the issue is highly priced at 96 plus and based on its FY21 earnings, it stands at 354. There is no harm in skipping this pricy IPO.
