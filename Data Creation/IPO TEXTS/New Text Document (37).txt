Mamata Machinery IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company enjoys a niche in innovative plastic bags and pouch-making machines, packaging machines, and extrusion equipment. It is a global player and has a manufacturing unit in the US to supply neighboring countries. It marked steady growth in its top and bottom lines for FY22-FY24. While based on Q1-FY25 the issue appears costly, but historically the first half is a lean period for them. They always have better second half. The management is confident of maintaining the growth trends posted. Based on FY24 earnings, the issue appears reasonably priced. Investors may park funds for the medium to long term.
