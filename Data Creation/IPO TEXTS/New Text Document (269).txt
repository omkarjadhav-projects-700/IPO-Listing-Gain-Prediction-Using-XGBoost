Siddhika Coatings IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  SCL has posted good earnings despite all odds for the last three fiscals. However, it suffered a severe setback due to pandemic for the first half of the current fiscal. Good back up in the form of free reserves and pricing of the IPO below 1 P/BV augurs well. Its prospects hinge on the restoration of normalcy which will bring back this company on track. The company has good fundamentals. Cash surplus investors may consider an investment with a long term perspective. Read detail review...
