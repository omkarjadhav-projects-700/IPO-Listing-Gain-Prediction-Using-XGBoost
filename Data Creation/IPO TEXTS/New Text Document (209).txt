AB Cotspin IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Based on super earnings for the last 15 months’ performance, the issue is lucratively priced, but if we consider its average performance for the last three fiscals, the issue is fully priced. Though the textile segment has been witnessing buying interest from some quarters on expectations of more sops for this labour oriented segment, many listed companies are available at cheaper valuations. The sustainability of recent margins enjoyed by the company is a major concern. Particularly its Q1-FY22 performance is raising eyebrows. Considering all these, risk seeker/cash surplus investors may consider parking their funds with a long term perspective. Others can ignore this IPO. Read detail review...
