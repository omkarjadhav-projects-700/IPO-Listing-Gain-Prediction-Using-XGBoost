Paras Defence IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  No doubt, spending on the defence and aerospace segment by the government has been on the rise and this augurs well for this company. However, based on its financial data the issue is fully priced discounting near term prospects. As the overall IPO size is below Rs. 250 cr. its initial listing will take place in T 2 T group limiting speculative movements. Hence cash surplus investors may consider investing in this issue for the long term. Read detail review...
