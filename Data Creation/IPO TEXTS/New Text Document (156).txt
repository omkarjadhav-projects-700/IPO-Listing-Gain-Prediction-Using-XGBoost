HMA Agro Industries IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  No doubt, there is uproar against this IPO from some investor community. But their apprehension about cow meat is totally misleading. This company is engaged in frozen buffalo meat exports and it is rising year over year amidst control of many regulatory bodies including APEDA. Based on its FY23 annualized earnings, the IPO appears reasonably priced. Well-informed/cash surplus investors may consider parking of funds for the medium to long-term rewards.
