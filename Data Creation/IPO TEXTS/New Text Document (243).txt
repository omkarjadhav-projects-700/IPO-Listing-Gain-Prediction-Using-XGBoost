Chemplast Sanmar IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  After a decade the company is trying to relist its shares with 7.5 times higher valuations. It has done many juggleries in the account as can be seen from frequent changes in the Face Value (FV) of its equity shares. Though the issue appears reasonably priced, it is due to the non-convincing super performance of FY21 and sustainability is a major concern. Hence cash surplus/risk seekers may consider investment, others can ignore it. Read detail review...
