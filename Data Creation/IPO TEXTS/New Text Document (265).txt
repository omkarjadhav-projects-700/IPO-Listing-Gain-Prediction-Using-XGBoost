Kuberan Global Edu IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The financial data is on a minuscule level with scanty profits. Based on the last three fiscals average EPS it is priced at a P/E of 46 and on the basis of FY20 earnings, it is at a P/E of 1000. If we consider super-profits for 7M-FY21 it is at a P/E of 28. There is no harm in giving this aggressively priced IPO a miss. Read detail review...
