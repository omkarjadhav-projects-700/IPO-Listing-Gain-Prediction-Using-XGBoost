Equitas Small Finance Bank IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company that was primarily the micro finance company is now turning small finance bank with diverse financial services. Based on Q1 FY21 earnings, the issue appears aggressively priced. Sustainability of such performance is doubtful with ongoing agitations by weaker sections for waiver of interest and PIL filed in Supreme Court in this regard (hearing is scheduled for first week of November 2020). Thus in near term, banking industry in general and SFBs/MFIs in particular are likely to face some setbacks. Considering these, investors may consider investment for long term. Read detail review...

Important Clarifications
Zerodha allows 1 IPO application per customer even though the option is available for applying in the retail and shareholders category. To apply the 2nd application, please use your net banking facility.
The shareholder list is prepared on PAN. Shareholders can apply from a different demat account (on the same name) where they do not hold EHL shares.
An investor will be identified by the PAN Number and not the Demat Account.
When using UPI as a payment method, the primary account holder in the bank and demat should be the same person. Use of 3rd party UPI ID or 3rd party bank account is not allowed.
When using ASBA, up to 5 IPO applications can be applied from the same bank, if the bank offers this facility. Public sector banks (like SBI) offer this facility.
Minors can only apply using ASBA from the banks that offer the 3rd Party ASBA IPO application. i.e. SBI. Click here for more detail.
