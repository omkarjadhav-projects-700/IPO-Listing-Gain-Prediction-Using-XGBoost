Concord Enviro Systems IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is a global player for water/wastewater treatment and other solutions involving ZLD technology. While it posted steady growth in its top lines for reported periods, it marked setback in bottom line for FY23. For 5M of FY25, it posted dismal earnings, indicating pressure on margins with rising competition. Based on its recent financial data, the issue appears fully priced discounting all near term positives. Well-informed investors may park funds for medium to long term. Read detail review...
