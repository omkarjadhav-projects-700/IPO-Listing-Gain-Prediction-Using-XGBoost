Cello World IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is having two household brands like “Cello” and “Unomax”. It has also marked steady growth in its top and bottom lines for the reported periods. It is having competition from many big players for the segments of the company. However, based on its recent financial performance, the issue is fully priced discounting all near term positives.
