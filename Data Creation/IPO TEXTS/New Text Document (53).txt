Godavari Biorefineries IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is the largest manufacturer of MPO worldwide and is engaged in ethanol based speciality chemicals. It suffered a setback in FY23 and FY24 following government banning ethanol production and the natural calamities during that periods. Though prima facie the IPO appears aggressively priced, considering the improved prospects following liberalized norms for ethanol production and increased ratio of around 20 for blending, the company is poised for bright prospects. Well-informed/cash surplus/risk seekers may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
