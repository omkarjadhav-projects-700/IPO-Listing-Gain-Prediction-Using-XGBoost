Delhivery IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  With continued losses, its IPO is priced with a negative P/E. Special accounting provisions kept its bottom lines in red for all these years despite growth in top lines. However, considering it's improving adjusted EBITDA margins (from -11.35% for FY19 to -0.72% for 9MFY22) DL is on the verge of turning the corner in the near term. Though its IPO is priced very aggressively, considering its growth plans and bright prospects ahead, this is a pure long term “High Risk – High Yield” bet. Cash surplus/risk seeker well-informed Investors may consider parking of funds. Read detail review...
