MTAR Technologies IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  On the prima facie, the issue is aggressively priced, but considering its last two fiscals earnings, orders on hands worth Rs. 336.2 cr. and its plan for more critical and high margin products with its niche play for space, security and defence segment, investors may consider parking their fund with a long term perspective. As a niche player with a virtual monopoly, the counter will gain fancy post listing, being the first mover in the segment. Read detail review...
