Nazara Technologies IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  With negative earnings for the past 18 months, the issue is being offered at a negative P/E. Simply due to investment by big tycoon RKJ, this IPO is creating hype. Being the first mover, it might catch fancy post listing, but the offer price is very aggressive based on its financial data. Hence cash surplus, risk savvy investors may consider investment at their own risks. Read detail review...
