Abans Holdings IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Based on its recent financial performance, the issue is priced aggressively. It is operating in a highly competitive segment of financial services. IPO allocation of just 10% for QIBs, 30% for HNIs, and 60% for Retail investors raises concern. Well-informed, cash surplus/risk seekers may consider parking funds. Read detail review...
