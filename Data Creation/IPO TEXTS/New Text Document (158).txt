Mankind Pharma IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  A major domestic player in healthcare products is going public with a pure vanilla OFS issue. It is diluting just 10% now. It has shown good financial performance from FY20 to FY22. The setback for 9m of FY23 is due to one-time provisioning for its recent takeovers. Based on recent performance, the issue appears fully priced. It’s a long race horse, hence investors may consider parking funds with a long-term perspective. Read detail review...
