Ekennis Software IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has an almost static top line for the reported financial data with super-profits for the last 21.5 months. Based on these super earnings, the issue is fully priced. Post-IPO it is paid-up capital of Rs. 1.40 cr. indicates longer gestation for migration to the mainboard. The company has not given a break-up of revenue and it appears it is primarily operating in digital and 3D printed packaging. Higher spending for the IPO indicates funding for this issue is fully arranged. There is no harm in ignoring this window dressed offer. Read detail review...
