Jetmall Spices IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The offer document is unpalatable and silent on many informal data. It has posted declining financial performance for the last three fiscals and whopping profits for the first half which is raising eyebrows. The asking price is at a P/E of 40 plus on the basis of the last three yearâ€™s average. The sustainability of FY21 first-half performance is a million-dollar question. Based on issue expenses criteria, this issue is fully structured. There is no harm in giving this issue a miss. Read detail review...
