Mrs.Bectors Food Specialities IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  After posting static performance for FY 18, FY19 and FY20, super performance for H1-FY21 surprises and raises concern. Sustainability of such performance amidst stiff competition from giants and the local players in the segment with organized and unorganized players remains a major worry. Based on FY20 earnings, the issue is priced around 56 P/E while on the basis of FY21 H1 annualized data, P/E is around 22. Thus if we exclude H1 FY 21 super performance, the issue appears fully priced. Since BFSL is in the top few players in the FMCG segment, investors may consider an investment with a medium to long term perspective. Read detail review...
