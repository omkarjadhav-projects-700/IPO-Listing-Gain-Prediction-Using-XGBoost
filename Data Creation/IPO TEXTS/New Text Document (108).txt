Azad Engineering IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is a niche player in its segment and enjoys virtual monopoly. It posted steady growth in its top line for the reported periods. Drastic fall in bottom line for FY23 is attributed to one-time adjustments as per new accounting norms. Based on FY24 annualized earnings, the issue appears fully priced. Considering bright prospects, it’s a worthy bet. Investors may park funds for the medium to long-term rewards. Read detail review...
