Popular Vehicles IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Though the company has presence in four states, it has over 400 touch points and that makes it the leader in the segment with a partnership with a front running Indian player Maruti. The company will continue to shift its product mix to improve its bottom lines. Based on FY24 annualized earnings, though the issue appears fully priced, it is worth considering for the medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
