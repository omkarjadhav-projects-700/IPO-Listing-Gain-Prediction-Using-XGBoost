J.G.Chemicals IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]   The company is India’s largest zinc oxide manufacturer serving to almost all top tyre manufacturing companies globally. After posting growth in its top and bottom lines for FY21 to FY23, it marked degrowth for 9M-FY24 on account of drastic fall in zinc oxide prices globally. As the reversal in trends are witnessed, the company will be back on track soon. Though based on FY24 annualized earnings, the issue appears fully priced, it is worth considering for the medium to long term rewards. Read detail review...
