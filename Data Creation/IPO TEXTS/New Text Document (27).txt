Quadrant Future Tek IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is engaged in developing research based new generation train control and signaling systems under “Kavach”. After posting average performance for FY22, it marked almost static top lines for FY23 and FY24, with boosted profits. Surprisingly, it marked loss for H1-FY25 leading to a negative P/E for its IPO price. Based on FY24 earnings, the issue appears exorbitantly priced. There is no harm in skipping this pricey and “High Risk/Low Return” bet. Read detail review...
