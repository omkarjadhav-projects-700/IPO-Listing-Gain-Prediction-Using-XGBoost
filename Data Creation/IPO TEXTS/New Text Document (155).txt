ideaForge Technology IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is the Indian leader in the UAS segment. It has posted growth in its top lines but for FY23, its bottom line marked decline due to ESOP impact. Though based on FY23 performance, the issue appears aggressively priced, well-informed/cash surplus investors may consider parking funds for long-term rewards. Read detail review...
