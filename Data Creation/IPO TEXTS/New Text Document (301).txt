Trekkingtoes.com IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Asking price does not match financial performance. Based on EPS and P/BV parameters, issue is exorbitantly priced. TCL is operating in a highly competitive segment with giants like Ola, Uber, Meru etc. Unorganized players are the major threats for this company. There is no harm in giving this issue a miss.
