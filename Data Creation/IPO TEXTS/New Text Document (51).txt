Deepak Builders IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company is an EPC contractors specializing in various types of constructions. It marked growth in its top and bottom lines for the reported periods, but sudden boost in margins for FY24 raise eyebrows. It has an order book worth Rs. 1380+ cr. as of June 30, 2024, with over 66% contribution from Railway contracts. Litigation matter amounting to over Rs. 87 cr. raises concern. Well-informed investors may park moderate funds for long term. Read detail review...
