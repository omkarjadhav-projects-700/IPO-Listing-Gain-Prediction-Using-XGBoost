Go Fashion IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company has suffered due to the pandemic and posted negative earnings for the last 15 months. Based on such dismal performance the issue is having negative P/E. However, it holds a pure long term story considering an expansion plan afoot to increase outlets from 450+ to 2000+ in the coming five to six years. The company hopes to be on track once full normalcy returns and regain its growth pattern on pre-pandemic lines. Its dependence on third party contracts remains a major concern. Hence, risk seekers/cash surplus investors may park funds for long term rewards. Read detail review...
