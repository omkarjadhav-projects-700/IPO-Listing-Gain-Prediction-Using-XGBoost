Aeroflex Industries IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  The company that enjoys a virtual monopoly has posted steady growth in its top and bottom lines for the reported periods. With over 80% export revenue it also has a status of EoU. It is a dividend-paying company. However, based on its working the IPO appears fully priced discounting all near-term positives. Well-informed investors may park funds for the medium to long-term rewards. Read detail review...
