Signatureglobal IPO Review
[Dilip Davda]  Though the company has lion market share in affordable housing in Delhi NCR region, its loss making journey so far makes the IPO exorbitantly priced with a negative P/E. The company has large projects on hand and with its sale realization, the company is likely to turn the table in the nearer term. But based on its performance so far, it’s a “High Risk/Low Return” bet. Hence only well-informed/cash surplus/risk seekers may park moderate funds for the long term rewards, others can skip it.
